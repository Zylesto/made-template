# Project Plan

## Summary

My data science project investigates the correlation between food prices and temperature change, with the goal of developing insights to help policymakers mitigate the negative impacts of climate change on food security.

## Rationale

<!-- Outline the impact of the analysis, e.g. which pains it solves. -->

The analysis helps to do correlate food prices in the world with the temperature change.

## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->

### Datasource1: Kaggle

## Work Packages

<!-- List of work packages ordered sequentially, each pointing to an issue with more details. -->

1. Extract Data from the two data sources
2. Create graphs & calculate correlation between food prices and temperature change
3. Draw Conclusion from the graphs
