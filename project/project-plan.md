# Project Plan

## Summary

This data science project aims to investigate the correlation between food prices and temperature changes. The goal is to derive insights that can aid policymakers in mitigating the adverse effects of climate change on food security.

## Rationale

The analysis trys to establish a correlation between global food prices and changes in temperature. By identifying trends and patterns within the data, the aim is to predict how future climatic changes might impact food supply and pricing. This knowledge is crucial for developing strategies to pre-empt and counteract potential negative consequences on food security due to climate change.
