# Project Plan

## Summary

My data science project investigates the correlation between food prices and temperature change, with the goal of developing insights to help policymakers mitigate the negative impacts of climate change on food security.

## Rationale

<!-- Outline the impact of the analysis, e.g. which pains it solves. -->

The analysis helps to do correlate food prices in the world with the temperature change.
