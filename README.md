# Project Work - Analyzing the Correlation Between Temperature Changes and Food Price Inflation in Selected African Countries
In a world that is rapidly changing, understading the complex interactions betwen climate changes and economic factors is crucail. My data science project takes on this challenge by exploring the relationships between temperature changes and food price inflation. This project aims to develop insights that could assist policy makers in mitigating the negative impacts of climate change on food security.

I will be examining how temperature and food prices inflation have evolved over the years, both in an regional african overview and in individual african countries. One of my key focus areas is the correlation between temperature changes and food price inflation globally, and then breaking it down for each country separately. In particular, I have chosen to concentrate on 25 African countries due to their unique vulnerability to climate change. This focus is motivated by the need to understand regional variations in these correlations and provide targeted recommendations for these nations.

In this report, I explore the following key topics:

- How Have Temperature Changes and Food Price Inflation Varied Over the Years?
- How Are Temperature Changes Correlated with Food Price Inflation?
- An Analysis of the Correlation Between Temperature Change and Food Price Inflation in Individual Countries
