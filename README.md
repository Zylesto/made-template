# Methods of Advanced Data Engineering Template Project

This template project provides some structure for your open data project in the MADE module at FAU.
This repository contains (a) a data science project that is developed by the student over the course of the semester, and (b) the exercises that are submitted over the course of the semester.
Before you begin, make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Jayvee](https://github.com/jvalue/jayvee) installed. We will work with [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/). The easiest way to do so is to set up [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Jupyter extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter).


## Project Work - Analyzing the Correlation Between Temperature Changes and Food Price Inflation in Selected African Countries
In a world that is rapidly changing, understading the complex interactions betwen climate changes and economic factors is crucail. My data science project takes on this challenge by exploring the relationships between temperature changes and food price inflation. This project aims to develop insights that could assist policy makers in mitigating the negative impacts of climate change on food security.

I will be examining how temperature and food prices inflation have evolved over the years, both in an regional african overview and in individual african countries. One of my key focus areas is the correlation between temperature changes and food price inflation globally, and then breaking it down for each country separately. In particular, I have chosen to concentrate on 25 African countries due to their unique vulnerability to climate change. This focus is motivated by the need to understand regional variations in these correlations and provide targeted recommendations for these nations.

In this report, I explore the following key topics:

- How Have Temperature Changes and Food Price Inflation Varied Over the Years?
- How Are Temperature Changes Correlated with Food Price Inflation?
- An Analysis of the Correlation Between Temperature Change and Food Price Inflation in Individual Countries

I warmly invite you to explore the results and insights of my project [here](https://github.com/Zylesto/made-template/blob/main/project/report.ipynb).

### Exporting a Jupyter Notebook
Jupyter Notebooks can be exported using `nbconvert` (`pip install nbconvert`). For example, to export the example notebook to html: `jupyter nbconvert --to html examples/final-report-example.ipynb --embed-images --output final-report.html`


## Exercises
During the semester you will need to complete exercises, sometimes using [Python](https://www.python.org/), sometimes using [Jayvee](https://github.com/jvalue/jayvee). You **must** place your submission in the `exercises` folder in your repository and name them according to their number from one to five: `exercise<number from 1-5>.<jv or py>`.

In regular intervalls, exercises will be given as homework to complete during the semester. We will divide you into two groups, one completing an exercise in Jayvee, the other in Python, switching each exercise. Details and deadlines will be discussed in the lecture, also see the [course schedule](https://made.uni1.de/). At the end of the semester, you will therefore have the following files in your repository:

1. `./exercises/exercise1.jv` or `./exercises/exercise1.py`
2. `./exercises/exercise2.jv` or `./exercises/exercise2.py`
3. `./exercises/exercise3.jv` or `./exercises/exercise3.py`
4. `./exercises/exercise4.jv` or `./exercises/exercise4.py`
5. `./exercises/exercise5.jv` or `./exercises/exercise5.py`

### Exercise Feedback
We provide automated exercise feedback using a GitHub action (that is defined in `.github/workflows/exercise-feedback.yml`). 

To view your exercise feedback, navigate to Actions -> Exercise Feedback in your repository.

The exercise feedback is executed whenever you make a change in files in the `exercise` folder and push your local changes to the repository on GitHub. To see the feedback, open the latest GitHub Action run, open the `exercise-feedback` job and `Exercise Feedback` step. You should see command line output that contains output like this:

```sh

Found output file airports.sqlite, grading...
